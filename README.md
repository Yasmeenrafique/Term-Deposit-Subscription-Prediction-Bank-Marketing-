# Term Deposit Subscription Prediction (Bank Marketing)

## 📌 Overview
This  focuses on predicting whether a bank customer will subscribe to a **term deposit** after a marketing campaign, using the **Bank Marketing Dataset (UCI Machine Learning Repository)**.  
The goal is to build predictive models that help banks optimize marketing strategies, reduce campaign costs, and target the right customers effectively.  

## 🎯 Objectives
- Load and explore the dataset  
- Encode categorical features properly  
- Train classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)  
- Evaluate models using Confusion Matrix, F1-Score, and ROC Curve  
- Apply **SHAP** or **LIME** to explain model predictions  

## 🛠️ Skills Gained
- Classification Modeling  
- Feature Encoding  
- Model Evaluation & Comparison  
- Explainable AI (XAI) with SHAP/LIME  
- Customer Behavior Analysis  


## 🚀 Workflow
1. Data loading and preprocessing  
2. Exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
3. Encoding categorical variables  
4. Model training (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)  
5. Model evaluation (Confusion Matrix, F1-Score, ROC Curve)  
6. Model interpretability with SHAP/LIME  

## 📊 Outcomes
- Identify key customer attributes influencing deposit subscription  
- Build a predictive model for campaign optimization  
- Provide explainability for business decision-making
